- Accent color: A subdued muted red (#A98D77), slightly darker than the primary, to draw the eye.
- Body and headline font: 'Literata', a serif typeface which gives a literary, vintage feel that emulates book pages. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use rounded corners and soft shadows to simulate the look of a physical book.
- Use subtle page-turning animations, simulating the turning of a real book page.
